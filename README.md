# Brandon Kubick - Engineering Portfolio

## NOTE
This project is still in work. See the To-Do section below for work in progress.

## Description
My Engineering Portfolio is a website built using a React, TypeScript, and Tailwind frontend, that
highlights my work experiences, personal projects, and various skills I have acquired through each experience.


## Purpose
As I build out my skillset, I need a centralized location that highlights my experience, projects, and skills.
To me, the best way to fully broadcast my skills was to build out a personal website that will house summaries
of all my current and previous work, along with the skills that each experience exemplifies.


## To-Do
1. Update Personal Project cards.
2. Get navbar display working.
3. Add skills and technology section.
4. Add and update all content.
5. Rethink design of cards.
6. Rethink design of page.
