# Brandon Kubick - Engineering Portfolio

## Description
My Engineering Portfolio is a website built using a React frontend, that
highlights my work experiences, personal projects, and various skills I have acquired through each experience.

### TODO: Once I figure out how I am going to deploy this website (Possibly Kubernetes and Helm), come back and add that to this section.

## Purpose
As I build out my skillset, I need a centralized location that highlights my experience, projects, and skills.
To me, the best way to fully broadcast my skills was to build out a personal website that will house summaries
of all my current and previous work, along with the skills that each experience exemplifies.

## Installing and Running
### TODO: Once I get this section hashed out, I need to come back to update this.
