# Brandon Kubick - Engineering Portfolio

## Description
My Engineering Portfolio is a website built using a React, TypeScript, and Tailwind frontend, that
highlights my work experiences, personal projects, and various skills I have acquired through each experience.

As I build out my skillset, I need a centralized location that highlights my experience, projects, and skills.
To me, the best way to fully broadcast my skills was to build out a personal website that will house summaries
of all my current and previous work, along with the skills that each experience exemplifies.

**NOTE** This project is still in work. See the To-Do section below for work in progress. I have it deployed on Github Pages for viewing as I continue to develop it:
