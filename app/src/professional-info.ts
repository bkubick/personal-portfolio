    about: `<p>
                I am a highly motivated individual seeking a mid-level position in Software Engineering.
                With a background as a Full-Stack Software Developer, and as an R&D Aerospace Engineer,
                I have excelled in both fields due to my strong focus, dedication, and passion for learning.

                <br/><br/>

                In my recent role as a full-stack engineer, I thrived in an Agile environment, where I
                contributed to the development and optimization of new and existing features on the
                company's platform. Notable projects include the development and integration of a separate
                API microservice and enhancing key areas of the platform to optimize performance and enhance
                user experience.

                <br/><br/>

                Prior to my transition to software, I spent two years as an Aerospace Engineer,
                honing fundamental skills such as project management, and the integration and analysis
                of complex systems. During this time, I served as the primary engineering contact for a
                major customer, further building the companyâ€™s trust with the client. Additionally, I led
                the thermal spray department as the lead engineer, where myself and two other engineers
                successfully integrated a new thermal spray booth to increase production.

                <br/><br/>

                I am driven by a continuous desire to learn and grow, and I am eager to apply my diverse
                skill set to new challenges as a Software Engineer.
            </p>`,
