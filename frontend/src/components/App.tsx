                            I am a highly motivated individual seeking a mid-level position in Software Engineering.
                            With a background as a Full-Stack Software Developer, and as an R&D Aerospace Engineer,
                            I have excelled in both fields due to my strong focus, dedication, and passion for learning.

                            <br/><br/>

                            In my recent role as a full-stack engineer, I thrived in an Agile environment, where I
                            contributed to the development and optimization of new and existing features on the
                            company's platform. Notable projects include the development and integration of a separate
                            API microservice and enhancing key areas of the platform to optimize performance and enhance
                            user experience.

                            <br/><br/>

                            Prior to my transition to software, I spent two years as an Aerospace Engineer,
                            honing fundamental skills such as project management, and the integration and analysis
                            of complex systems. During this time, I served as the primary engineering contact for a
                            major customer, further building the companyâ€™s trust with the client. Additionally, I led
                            the thermal spray department as the lead engineer, where myself and two other engineers
                            successfully integrated a new thermal spray booth to increase production.

                            <br/><br/>

                            I am driven by a continuous desire to learn and grow, and I am eager to apply my diverse
                            skill set to new challenges as a Software and/or Mechanical Engineer.
